    <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <h2>Altria Pendragon(Fate/stay night)</h2>
        <p>A legendary king of Britain. Also called the King of Knights.
        Artoria is a childhood name and, upon being raised as a king, she began to be called King Arthur.
        In an age when chivalry had lost its beauty, with a holy sword in her hands, she brought about a brief moment of peace and final prosperity to Britain.
        A man in historical fact, but it seems that in this world she was a cross-dressing beauty.</p>
